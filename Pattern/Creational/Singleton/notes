Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures a 
class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.

Real world Example
1. Database Connection instance
2. Logger

Code Explanation
Private constructor → prevents new Logger()
Static instance → belongs to class, not object
getInstance() → single access point
synchronized → thread safety
